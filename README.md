# DSAN-5200-Project

# If you're working within the Rproject and having trouble opening files, remember that any script you have open in the Rproject will treat the folder that the .Rproj file is in as the root. For instance, if you are in project/codeScripts, you will need to open files by going to data/whatever, not ../data/whatever
