## Who Is Affected? Obesity and Malnutrition

### Tracking Obesity and Malnutrition Throughout the 21st Century

Malnourishment and obesity represent two important and interconnected global health challenges. Malnourishment can be characterized as the inadequate intake of essential nutrients, whereas obesity is the excessive intake of nutrient-poor foods. Malnourishment affects millions worldwide, more often in low-income regions. Obesity affects millions across all ages, genders, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Addressing both health issues necessitates concerted efforts and global cooperation that prioritizes equality and sustainability.

From 2000 through 2016, Europe maintained a higher average obesity rate compared to Africa. Obesity continued to rise in both continents, although the growth was relatively small, reaching a maximum of 0.41% increase. 

In 2016, both Europe and Africa recorded their highest average obesity rates of 22.74% and 11.78%, respectively. In 2000, both continents reported the lowest average obesity rates, at 16.83% in Europe and 6.78% in Africa. Notably, Europe’s lowest average obesity rate surpassed any recorded average obesity rate in Africa during this time period. These averages highlight a pronounced difference in obesity between Europe and Africa.

<iframe src="viz/Malnour-Hist.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>

Between 2000 and 2016, Africa consistently exhibited a higher average malnourishment rate compared to Europe. 

Africa’s average malnourishment rate peaked at 24.14% in 2000, while Europe reached its highest rate of 10.48% in 2004. Conversely, Africa achieved its lowest average malnourishment rate of 17.81% in 2011, whereas Europe hit its lowest average rate of 3.60% in 2016.

In Europe, the largest spike in malnourishment was from 2003 to 2004 at 2.86%. While we cannot be certain, this may be because of the outbreak of conflict occurring in Kosovo, and the ramifications of the Rose Revolution in Georgia. During the same time period, the average malnourishment rate actually decreased in Africa by 0.64%. Interestingly, Europe had a sharp decline in malnourishment from 2006 to 2010, totaling to 6.29%, perhaps suggesting a recovery from the earlier periods of conflict. Africa's average malnourishment rate continually decreased from 2000 to 2011, amounting to 6.33%. These trends underscore a disparity in malnutrition prevalence between the two continents.

### Visualizing Food Supply Disparity by Country

The overall average rate of malnourishment in Africa, when calculated over the 20-odd years since the turn of the century, stands at 20.29%, contrasting with Europe’s average rate of 2.88%. The overall average rate of obesity in Africa is 9.50%, while in Europe it is 19.51%. Based on these averages, it's evident that obesity had a greater impact on Europe than Africa, while malnutrition had a more pronounced effect on Africa compared to Europe during this time period. These averages suggest an inverse relationship between the malnourishment rate and the obesity rate in these continents.

Furthermore, there were a handful of countries who impressively maintained a malnutrition rate and obesity rate of less than 10.0% These countries include Mali, Nigeria, Ghana, Mauritius, and Mauritania. Of these countries, the average obesity rates ranged from 6.01% to 9.57% and the average malnourishment rates ranged from 5.42% to 9.19%.

In Europe, Malta has the highest average obesity rate of 26.04%, while Libya leads in Africa with an average obesity rate of 27.79%. In contrast, Bosnia and Herzegovina have the lowest average obesity rate in Europe at 15.05%, whereas Ethiopia has the lowest average obesity rate in Africa at 3.04%. Remarkably, Europe’s lowest average obesity rate is approximately five times higher than Africa’s lowest average obesity rate. 

<iframe src = "viz/Malnourishment-Map.html" width = 800, height = 800></iframe>

In Europe, Albania has the highest average malnourishment rate at 6.04%, while Somalia has the highest average malnourishment rate in Africa at 66.39%. This indicates that Somalia’s average malnutrition rate exceeds that of Albania by more than tenfold during this period.

In Europe, 22 countries exhibited an average malnourishment rate of less than 2.50%. These countries had their rates denoted as “<2.5%” in the data. Consequently, we treated these rates as a constant of 2.5%. Those countries are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. In Africa, Tunisia holds the lowest average malnourishment rate of 3.65%.

## Political Climate and Food Supply

We've spent some time looking at the relationship between economic disparity and food security, and some of the health impacts of that relationship. Now we'd like to add political stability into the mix.

The UN issues an annual Political Security Index to each country, representing the perception that there will be political violence in the country. It is important to not that this is not a simple process, and that this rating does not represent the likelihood of political violence, merely the perception of the global community that a country is more or less prone to it. This score tends to range between -2.5 (extremely high perception of the likelihood of political violence, aka "perceived politically unstable") to 2.5 (extremely low perception of the likelihood of political violence, aka "perceived politically stable"), with a score of 0 acting as a separating boundary between perceived as politically unstable vs stable. For the ease of discussion, we'll drop the repeated use of the word "perception" and let "political stability" represent the Political Security Index. Now, let's see what the relationship is between economic power (as measured by GDP per capita, as we have seen above) and political stability since the turn of the century.

<iframe src = "viz/polGDP.html" width = 800 height = 400> </iframe>

The first thing that may jump out at you with this plot is the disparity between Europe and Africa in both categories. The larger dots represent an average of each continent (not by population, but simply by country), and we can see how African countries on average have both low GDP per capita and low political stability; Europe, by contrast, on average has both higher GDP per capita and political stability. Europe has a much larger spread in terms of GDP per capita, with a clear trend: European countries with lower political stability tend to have smaller economies per citizen. Additionally, over time Europe has increased it's GDP per capita, moving further to the right from where it started, with relatively little difference in political stability. This is in contrast to Africa; African countries on average have not seen a similar growth in GDP per capita since 2002, and have also dipped slightly in political stability. There is also stronger clustering in Africa in a way that we do not see with Europe; most of the more politically stable African nations do not see a marked increase in GDP per capita when compare to their political unstable neighbors. Despite these clear continental difference, one point of commonality can be found. We can see two major economic contracting points that spanned both continents, when almost every country's GDP per capita saw a decrease from the year before: namely, the 2008-09 economic recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Some larger jumps in political stability that we see when allowing time to progress on the plot can be put into historical context. Ukraine hovers around the 0 margin until 2014, when it dips into the deeply negative political index scores at below -2, one of the only European nations to reach such a low, and remains low until starting to creep back up slowly in 2019; this is likely due to the conflict with and subsequent invasion from Russia (which, interestingly enough, achieves it's maximum high in 2018). In Africa, Libya shifts from being one of the wealthier African nations with a political stability on par with Europe in 2009, before immediately steeply dropping in political stability and fluctuating greatly in GDP per capita, with a political stability score well below -2 in 2014, where it remains today. We can attribute this in part to the tensions that arose in 2010 with the first stirrings of the Arab Spring and the outbreak in 2011 of the Libyan Civil War. 

There are a myriad of factors that go into both political stability, GDP, and total population of a country, and it would be remiss of us to say that one is directly and linearly affected by the other. But it is clear from this graph that there is a strong relationship between the two. It may be that European countries are able to grow their GDP per capita because of their overall political stability, whereas many African nations struggle to do the same. Or perhaps the inverse is true, and lower GDP per capita tends to exacerbate the prevalence of political violence. There is also a proximity element that is important not to discount. If a country is politically unstable, that could lead to political unrest in their neighbors as issues spill across border; similarly, 

We should also keep in mind that dividing GDP across an entire population via averaging loses any measurement of income or wealth inequality (inequalities which here in the United States have led to unrest). In that respect, a median income level per person may be a more telling metric to compare against politically stability, but sadly that data is not included in our analytical dataset. On a different note, it is also not possible to immediately pull out authoritarian or democratic governmental groups from this plot, and governmental structure affects both economic and political environments. 

Now that we've spent some time discussing political stability and it's relationship to a country's income and population, let's return to food. We'll be revisiting one metric we saw in the beginning of this article, and adding a new one.

Above, we can watch in rolling three year averages the comparison of two food security metrics against political stability: protein supply (in grams per person per day) and dietary energy supply adequacy. Again we have two larger dots representing the averages taken across all countries during each period, and again we can see clear clustering, especially in the lefthand plot.

Looking at protein supply and political stability, we again see the same levels of average political stability as in the previous graph, with Europe averaging politically stable and Africa averaging politically unstable. We also see that the majority of countries in Europe have, for the average person in their society, more than 80 grams of protein a day, whereas only roughly a third of African countries do.
